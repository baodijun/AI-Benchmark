A very small yet already powerful neural network that is able to recognize 1000 different object classes based on a single photo with an accuracy of ~72%. After quantization its size is less than 4Mb, which together with its low RAM consumption allows to lanch it on almost any currently existing smartphone.

A different approach for the same task: now significantly more accurate, but at the expense of 4x larger size and tough computational requirements. As a clear bonus - can process images of higher resolutions, which allows more accurate recognition and smaller object detection.
